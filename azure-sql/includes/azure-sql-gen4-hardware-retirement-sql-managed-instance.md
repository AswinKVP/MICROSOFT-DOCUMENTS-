> [!IMPORTANT]
> [Gen4 hardware is being retired](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/gen-4-hardware-on-azure-sql-database-approaching-end-of-life-in-2020) and is not available for new deployments, as announced on December 18, 2019. Customers using Gen4 hardware for Azure SQL Database, elastic pools, or SQL Managed Instance should migrate to currently available hardware, such as standard-series (Gen5), **before March 31, 2023**.
>
> By March 31, 2023, existing Gen4 SQL managed instances will be migrated automatically to equivalent or better hardware. If upgraded automatically, managed instances may be upgraded to premium-series hardware, which will result in price increase in accordance with [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/azure-sql-managed-instance/single/#pricing). 
>
> Downtime caused by automatic migration will be minimal and similar to downtime during scaling operations within selected service tier. To avoid unplanned interruptions to workloads, migrate proactively at the time of your choice before March 31, 2023.
