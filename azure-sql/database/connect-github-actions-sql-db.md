# Use GitHub Actions to connect to Azure SQL Database

Get started with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) by using a workflow to deploy database updates to [Azure SQL Database](../azure-sql-iaas-vs-paas-what-is-overview.md). 

## Prerequisites

You will need:
- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- A GitHub repository with a dacpac package (`Database.dacpac`). If you don't have a GitHub account, [sign up for free](https://github.com/join).  
- An Azure SQL Database.
    - [Quickstart: Create an Azure SQL Database single database](single-database-create-quickstart.md)
    - [How to create a dacpac package from your existing SQL Server Database](/sql/relational-databases/data-tier-applications/export-a-data-tier-application)

## Workflow file overview

A GitHub Actions workflow is defined by a YAML (.yml) file in the `/.github/workflows/` path in your repository. This definition contains the various steps and parameters that make up the workflow.

The file has two sections:

|Section  |Tasks  |
|---------|---------|
|**Authentication** | 1.1. Generate deployment credentials. |
|**Deploy** | 1. Deploy the database. |

## Generate deployment credentials

# [Service principal](#tab/userlevel)

You can create a [service principal](/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals) with the [az ad sp create-for-rbac](/cli/azure/ad/sp#az-ad-sp-create-for-rbac) command in the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/). Run this command with [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) in the Azure portal or by selecting the **Try it** button.

Replace the placeholders `server-name` with the name of your SQL server hosted on Azure. Replace the `subscription-id` and `resource-group` with the subscription ID and resource group connected to your SQL server.  

```azurecli-interactive
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name {server-name} --role contributor 
                            --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group} 
                            --sdk-auth
```

The output is a JSON object with the role assignment credentials that provide access to your database similar to this example. Copy your output JSON object for later.

```output 
  {
    "clientId": "<GUID>",
    "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
    "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
    "tenantId": "<GUID>",
    (...)
  }
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is always a good practice to grant minimum access. The scope in the previous example is limited to the specific server and not the entire resource group.

# [OpenID Connect](#tab/openid)

OpenID Connect is an authentication method that uses short-lived tokens. Setting up [OpenID Connect with GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect) is more complex process that offers hardened security. 

1.  If you do not have an existing application, register a [new Active Directory application and service principal that can access resources](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal). Create the Active Directory application. 

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az ad app create --display-name myApp
    ```

    This command will output JSON with an `appId` that is your `client-id`. Save the value to use as the `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` GitHub secret later. 

    You'll use the `objectId` value when creating federated credentials with Graph API and reference it as the `APPLICATION-OBJECT-ID`.

1. Create a service principal. Replace the `$appID` with the appId from your JSON output. 

    This command generates JSON output with a different `objectId` and will be used in the next step. The new  `objectId` is the `assignee-object-id`. 
    
    Copy the `appOwnerTenantId` to use as a GitHub secret for `AZURE_TENANT_ID` later. 

    ```azurecli-interactive
     az ad sp create --id $appId
    ```

1. Create a new role assignment by subscription and object. By default, the role assignment will be tied to your default subscription. Replace `$subscriptionId` with your subscription ID, `$resourceGroupName` with your resource group name, and `$assigneeObjectId` with the generated `assignee-object-id`. Learn [how to manage Azure subscriptions with the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/manage-azure-subscriptions-azure-cli).

    ```azurecli-interactive
    az role assignment create --role contributor --subscription $subscriptionId --assignee-object-id  $assigneeObjectId --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal --scopes /subscriptions/$subscriptionId/resourceGroups/$resourceGroupName/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/
    ```

1. Run the following command to [create a new federated identity credential](/graph/api/application-post-federatedidentitycredentials?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) for your active directory application.

    * Replace `APPLICATION-OBJECT-ID` with the **objectId (generated while creating app)** for your Active Directory application.
    * Set a value for `CREDENTIAL-NAME` to reference later.
    * Set the `subject`. The value of this is defined by GitHub depending on your workflow:
      * Jobs in your GitHub Actions environment: `repo:< Organization/Repository >:environment:< Name >`
      * For Jobs not tied to an environment, include the ref path for branch/tag based on the ref path used for triggering the workflow: `repo:< Organization/Repository >:ref:< ref path>`.  For example, `repo:n-username/ node_express:ref:refs/heads/my-branch` or `repo:n-username/ node_express:ref:refs/tags/my-tag`.
      * For workflows triggered by a pull request event: `repo:< Organization/Repository >:pull_request`.
    
    ```azurecli
    az rest --method POST --uri 'https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/applications/<APPLICATION-OBJECT-ID>/federatedIdentityCredentials' --body '{"name":"<CREDENTIAL-NAME>","issuer":"https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com","subject":"repo:organization/repository:ref:refs/heads/main","description":"Testing","audiences":["api://AzureADTokenExchange"]}' 
    ```

## Copy the SQL connection string

In the Azure portal, go to your Azure SQL Database and open **Settings** > **Connection strings**. Copy the **ADO.NET** connection string. Replace the placeholder values for `your_database` and `your_password`. The connection string will look similar to this output. 

```output
    Server=tcp:my-sql-server.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog={your-database};Persist Security Info=False;User ID={admin-name};Password={your-password};MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;
```

You'll use the connection string as a GitHub secret. 

## Configure the GitHub secrets

# [Service principal](#tab/userlevel)

1. In [GitHub](https://github.com/), browse your repository.

1. Select **Settings > Secrets > New secret**.

1. Paste the entire JSON output from the Azure CLI command into the secret's value field. Give the secret the name `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`.

    When you configure the workflow file later, you use the secret for the input `creds` of the Azure Login action. For example:

    ```yaml
    - uses: azure/login@v1
    with:
        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
   ```

1. Select **New secret** again. 

1. Paste the connection string value into the secret's value field. Give the secret the name `AZURE_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING`.

# [OpenID Connect](#tab/openid)

You need to provide your application's **Client ID**, **Tenant ID**, and **Subscription ID** to the login action. These values can either be provided directly in the workflow or can be stored in GitHub secrets and referenced in your workflow. Saving the values as GitHub secrets is the more secure option.

1. Open your GitHub repository and go to **Settings**.

1. Select **Settings > Secrets > New secret**.

1. Create secrets for `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, and `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`. Use these values from your Active Directory application for your GitHub secrets:

    |GitHub Secret  | Active Directory Application  |
    |---------|---------|
    |AZURE_CLIENT_ID     |      Application (client) ID   |
    |AZURE_TENANT_ID     |     Directory (tenant) ID    |
    |AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID     |     Subscription ID    |

1. Save each secret by selecting **Add secret**.

## Add your workflow

1. Go to **Actions** for your GitHub repository. 

2. Select **Set up your workflow yourself**. 

2. Delete everything after the `on:` section of your workflow file. For example, your remaining workflow may look like this. 

    ```yaml
    name: CI

    on:
    push:
        branches: [ main ]
    pull_request:
        branches: [ main ]
    ```

1. Rename your workflow `SQL for GitHub Actions` and add the checkout and login actions. These actions will check out your site code and authenticate with Azure using the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` GitHub secret you created earlier.

    # [Service principal](#tab/userlevel)

    ```yaml
    name: SQL for GitHub Actions

    on:
    push:
        branches: [ main ]
    pull_request:
        branches: [ main ]

    jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: windows-latest
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v1
        - uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
            creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
    ```

    # [OpenID Connect](#tab/openid)

    ```yaml
    name: SQL for GitHub Actions

    on:
    push:
        branches: [ main ]
    pull_request:
        branches: [ main ]

    jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: windows-latest
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v1
        - uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
            client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
            tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
            subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
    ```
  
  ---

1. Use the Azure SQL Deploy action to connect to your SQL instance. Replace `SQL_SERVER_NAME` with the name of your server. You should have a dacpac package (`Database.dacpac`) at the root level of your repository. 

    ```yaml
    - uses: azure/sql-action@v1
      with:
        server-name: SQL_SERVER_NAME
        connection-string: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING }}
        dacpac-package: './Database.dacpac'
    ```

1. Complete your workflow by adding an action to logout of Azure. Here's the completed workflow. The file will appear in the `.github/workflows` folder of your repository.

    # [Service principal](#tab/userlevel)

    ```yaml
    name: SQL for GitHub Actions

    on:
    push:
        branches: [ main ]
    pull_request:
        branches: [ main ]


    jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: windows-latest
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v1
        - uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
            creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

    - uses: azure/sql-action@v1
      with:
        server-name: SQL_SERVER_NAME
        connection-string: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING }}
        dacpac-package: './Database.dacpac'

        # Azure logout 
    - name: logout
      run: |
         az logout
    ```

    # [OpenID Connect](#tab/openid)

    ```yaml
    name: SQL for GitHub Actions

    on:
    push:
        branches: [ main ]
    pull_request:
        branches: [ main ]


    jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: windows-latest
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v1
        - uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
            client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
            tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
            subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
    - uses: azure/sql-action@v1
      with:
        server-name: SQL_SERVER_NAME
        connection-string: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SQL_CONNECTION_STRING }}
        dacpac-package: './Database.dacpac'

        # Azure logout 
    - name: logout
      run: |
         az logout
    ```
