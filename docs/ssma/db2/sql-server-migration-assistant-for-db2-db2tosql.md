# SQL Server Migration Assistant for DB2 (DB2ToSQL)

[!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] Migration Assistant (SSMA) for DB2 is a tool for migrating DB2 databases to:

- [!INCLUDE [sssql11-md](../../includes/sssql11-md.md)]
- [!INCLUDE [sssql14-md](../../includes/sssql14-md.md)]
- [!INCLUDE [sssql16-md](../../includes/sssql16-md.md)]
- [!INCLUDE [sssql17-md](../../includes/sssql17-md.md)] (on Windows and Linux)
- [!INCLUDE [sssql19-md](../../includes/sssql19-md.md)] (on Windows and Linux)
- [!INCLUDE [sssql22-md](../../includes/sssql22-md.md)] (on Windows and Linux)
- Azure SQL Database

SSMA for DB2 converts DB2 database objects to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] database objects, creates those objects in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)], and then migrates data from DB2 to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] or Azure SQL Database.

This documentation introduces you to SSMA for DB2 and provides step-by-step instructions for migrating DB2 databases to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)]. The following table shows articles to help you learn more:
