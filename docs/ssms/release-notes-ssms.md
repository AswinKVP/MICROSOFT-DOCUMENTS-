#### Uninstall and reinstall SSMS 17.x

If your SSMS installation is having problems, and a standard uninstall and reinstall doesn't resolve them, you can first try [repairing](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4028054/windows-10-repair-or-remove-programs) the Visual Studio 2015 IsoShell. If repairing the Visual Studio 2015 IsoShell doesn't resolve the problem, the following steps have been found to fix many random issues:

1. Uninstall SSMS the same way you uninstall any application (using *Apps & features*, *Programs, and features*, depending on your version of Windows).

1. Uninstall Visual Studio 2015 IsoShell **from an elevated cmd prompt**:

    ```PUSHD "C:\ProgramData\Package Cache\FE948F0DAB52EB8CB5A740A77D8934B9E1A8E301\redist"```
    ```vs_isoshell.exe /Uninstall /Force /PromptRestart```

1. Uninstall Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable the same way you uninstall any application. Uninstall both x86 and x64 if they're on your computer.

1. Reinstall Visual Studio 2015 IsoShell **from an elevated cmd prompt**:

    ```PUSHD "C:\ProgramData\Package Cache\FE948F0DAB52EB8CB5A740A77D8934B9E1A8E301\redist"```
    ```vs_isoshell.exe /PromptRestart```

1. Reinstall SSMS.

1. Upgrade to the [latest version of the Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) if you're not currently up to date.
