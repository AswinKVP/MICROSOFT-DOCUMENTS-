# Install the SQL Server command-line tools sqlcmd and bcp on Linux

[!INCLUDE [SQL Server - Linux](../includes/applies-to-version/sql-linux.md)]

The following steps install the command-line tools, Microsoft ODBC drivers, and their dependencies. The **mssql-tools** package contains:

- **sqlcmd**: Command-line query utility.
- **bcp**: Bulk import-export utility.

Install the tools for your platform:

- [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](?tabs=redhat-install#RHEL)
- [SUSE Linux Enterprise Server](?tabs=sles-install#SLES)
- [Ubuntu](?tabs=ubuntu-install#ubuntu)
- [macOS](#macos)
- [Docker](#docker)

This article describes how to install the command-line tools. If you are looking for examples of how to use **sqlcmd** or **bcp**, see the [links](#next-steps) at the end of this article.

> [!WARNING]  
> sqlcmd and bcp are available in mssql-tools for x64 architecture. An alternative for both arm64 and x64 environments is in preview across Linux, macOS, and Windows, [go-sqlcmd on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/go-sqlcmd).

## Install tools on Linux

### [RHEL 8](#tab/redhat-install)

<a id="RHEL"></a>

Use the following steps to install the **mssql-tools** on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

1. Enter superuser mode.

   ```bash
   sudo su
   ```

1. Download the Microsoft Red Hat repository configuration file.

   ```bash
   curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/rhel/8/prod.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/msprod.repo
   ```

1. Exit superuser mode.

   ```bash
   exit
   ```

1. If you had a previous version of **mssql-tools** installed, remove any older unixODBC packages.

   ```bash
   sudo yum remove mssql-tools unixODBC-utf16-devel
   ```

1. Run the following commands to install **mssql-tools** with the unixODBC developer package.

   ```bash
   sudo yum install mssql-tools unixODBC-devel
   ```

   > [!NOTE]  
   > To update to the latest version of **mssql-tools** run the following commands:
   >
   > ```bash
   > sudo yum check-update
   > sudo yum update mssql-tools
   > ```

1. **Optional**: Add `/opt/mssql-tools/bin/` to your **PATH** environment variable in a bash shell.

   To make **sqlcmd/bcp** accessible from the bash shell for login sessions, modify your **PATH** in the **~/.bash_profile** file with the following command:

   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin"' >> ~/.bash_profile
   ```

   To make **sqlcmd/bcp** accessible from the bash shell for interactive/non-login sessions, modify the **PATH** in the **~/.bashrc** file with the following command:

   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

### [SLES 12](#tab/sles-install)

<a id="SLES"></a>

Use the following steps to install the **mssql-tools** on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.

1. Add the Microsoft SQL Server repository to Zypper.

   ```bash
   sudo zypper addrepo -fc https://packages.microsoft.com/config/sles/12/prod.repo
   sudo zypper --gpg-auto-import-keys refresh
   ```

1. Install **mssql-tools** with the unixODBC developer package.

   ```bash
   sudo zypper install mssql-tools unixODBC-devel
   ```

   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin"' >> ~/.bash_profile
   ```

   To make **sqlcmd/bcp** accessible from the bash shell for interactive/non-login sessions, modify the **PATH** in the **~/.bashrc** file with the following command:

   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

### [Ubuntu 20.04](#tab/ubuntu-install)

<a id="ubuntu"></a>

Use the following steps to install the **mssql-tools** on Ubuntu.

> [!NOTE]  
>  
> - Ubuntu 18.04 is supported starting with SQL Server 2019 CU3.
> - Ubuntu 20.04 is supported starting with SQL Server 2019 CU10.
> - If you are using Ubuntu 16.04 or Ubuntu 18.04, change the repository path in step 2 below from `/ubuntu/20.04` to `/ubuntu/16.04` or `/ubuntu/18.04`.

1. Import the public repository GPG keys.

   ```bash
   curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -
   ```

1. Register the Microsoft Ubuntu repository.

   ```bash
   curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/20.04/prod.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/msprod.list
   ```

1. Update the sources list and run the installation command with the unixODBC developer package.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install mssql-tools unixodbc-dev
   ```

   > [!NOTE]  
   > To update to the latest version of **mssql-tools** run the following commands:
   >
   > ```bash
   > sudo apt-get update  
   > sudo apt-get install mssql-tools  
   > ```

1. **Optional**: Add `/opt/mssql-tools/bin/` to your **PATH** environment variable in a bash shell.

   To make **sqlcmd/bcp** accessible from the bash shell for login sessions, modify your **PATH** in the **~/.bash_profile** file with the following command:

   ```bash

## <a id="macos"></a> Install tools on macOS

A preview of **sqlcmd** and **bcp** is now available on macOS. For more information, see the [announcement](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/dataplatforminsider/2017/05/16/sql-server-command-line-tools-for-macos-released/).

*Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) if you don't have it already:*

- `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

To install the tools for Mac El Capitan and Sierra, use the following commands:

```bash
# brew untap microsoft/mssql-preview if you installed the preview version
brew tap microsoft/mssql-release https://github.com/Microsoft/homebrew-mssql-release
brew update
brew install mssql-tools
#for silent install:
#HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_FILTERING=1 ACCEPT_EULA=y brew install mssql-tools
```

## <a id="docker"></a> Install tools on Docker

If you [run SQL Server in a Docker container](quickstart-install-connect-docker.md), the SQL Server command-line tools are already included in the SQL Server Linux container image. If you attach to a running container with an interactive bash shell, you can run the tools locally.

If you are creating a container with the SQL Server command-line tools, it is recommended to add `ACCEPT_EULA=Y` to the installation command to silently accept the EULA and not interrupt image creation.  An example final command as part of installation on an Ubuntu-based image is:

```bash
sudo ACCEPT_EULA=Y apt-get install mssql-tools unixodbc-dev
```

## Offline installation

[!INCLUDE [offline-package-install-intro](includes/offline-package-install-intro.md)]

### [Red Hat](#tab/redhat-offline)

1. First, locate and copy the **mssql-tools** package for your Linux distribution. For Red Hat 8.0, this is located at [https://packages.microsoft.com/rhel/8/prod](https://packages.microsoft.com/rhel/8/prod).

1. Also locate and copy the **msodbcsql** package, which is a dependency. The **msodbcsql** package also has a dependency on **unixODBC-devel**. For Red Hat, the **msodbcsql** package is located at [https://packages.microsoft.com/rhel/8/prod](https://packages.microsoft.com/rhel/8/prod).

1. **Move the downloaded packages to your Linux machine**. If you used a different machine to download the packages, one way to move the packages to your Linux machine is with the **scp** command.

1. **Install the and packages**: Install the **mssql-tools** and **msodbc** packages. If you get any dependency errors, ignore them until the next step. Replace `<version>` with the correct version:

   ```bash
   sudo yum localinstall msodbcsql-<version>.rpm
   sudo yum localinstall mssql-tools-<version>.rpm
   ```

1. **Resolve missing dependencies**: You might have missing dependencies at this point. If not, you can skip this step. In some cases, you must manually locate and install these dependencies.

   You can inspect the required dependencies with the following commands. Replace `<version>` with the correct version:

   ```bash
   rpm -qpR msodbcsql-<version>.rpm
   rpm -qpR mssql-tools-<version>.rpm
    ```

### [SLES](#tab/sles-offline)

1. First, locate and copy the **mssql-tools** package for your Linux distribution. For SLES 12, this is located at [https://packages.microsoft.com/sles/12/prod](https://packages.microsoft.com/sles/12/prod).

1. Also locate and copy the **msodbcsql** package, which is a dependency. The **msodbcsql** package also has a dependency on **unixODBC-devel**. For SLES, the **msodbcsql** package is located at [https://packages.microsoft.com/sles/12/prod](https://packages.microsoft.com/sles/12/prod).

1. **Move the downloaded packages to your Linux machine**. If you used a different machine to download the packages, one way to move the packages to your Linux machine is with the **scp** command.

1. **Install the and packages**: Install the **mssql-tools** and **msodbc** packages. If you get any dependency errors, ignore them until the next step. Replace `<version>` with the correct version:

   ```bash
   sudo zypper install msodbcsql-<version>.rpm
   sudo zypper install mssql-tools-<version>.rpm
   ```

1. **Resolve missing dependencies**: You might have missing dependencies at this point. If not, you can skip this step. In some cases, you must manually locate and install these dependencies.

   You can inspect the required dependencies with the following commands. Replace `<version>` with the correct version:

   ```bash
   rpm -qpR msodbcsql-<version>.rpm
   rpm -qpR mssql-tools-<version>.rpm
    ```

### [Ubuntu](#tab/ubuntu-offline)

1. First, locate and copy the **mssql-tools** package for your Linux distribution. For Ubuntu 20.04, this is located at [https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/20.04/prod/pool/main/m/mssql-tools](https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/20.04/prod/pool/main/m/mssql-tools) |

1. Also locate and copy the **msodbcsql** package, which is a dependency. The **msodbcsql** package also has a dependency on **unixodbc-dev**. For Ubuntu, the **msodbcsql** packages are located at [**msodbcsql**](https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/20.04/prod/pool/main/m/msodbcsql17/), and [**unixodbc-dev**](https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/20.04/prod/pool/main/u/unixodbc/).

1. **Move the downloaded packages to your Linux machine**. If you used a different machine to download the packages, one way to move the packages to your Linux machine is with the **scp** command.

1. **Install the and packages**: Install the **mssql-tools** and **msodbc** packages. If you get any dependency errors, ignore them until the next step. Replace `<version>` with the correct version:

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i msodbcsql_<version>.deb
   sudo dpkg -i mssql-tools_<version>.deb
   ```

1. **Resolve missing dependencies**: You might have missing dependencies at this point. If not, you can skip this step. In some cases, you must manually locate and install these dependencies.

   If you have access to approved repositories containing those dependencies, the easiest solution is to use the **apt-get** command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get -f install
   ```

   > [!NOTE]  
   > This command completes the installation of the SQL Server packages as well.

   If this doesn't work for your Debian package, you can inspect the required dependencies with the following commands:

   ```bash
   dpkg -I msodbcsql_<version>_amd64.deb | grep "Depends:"
   dpkg -I mssql-tools_<version>_amd64.deb | grep "Depends:"
   ```
