# Administration resources for Big Data Clusters

[!INCLUDE[SQL Server 2019](../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver2019.md)]

This article explains how to view the status of a big data cluster by using Azure Data Studio, notebooks, and Azure Data CLI (azdata) commands.

## Know your architecture

Starting with SQL Server 2019 (15.x), [!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-2019](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)] allow you to deploy scalable clusters of SQL Server, Spark, and HDFS containers that run on Kubernetes. For an overview, see [What are SQL Server Big Data Clusters?](big-data-cluster-overview.md)

[!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-2019](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)] provide coherent and consistent authorization and authentication. For an overview of Big Data Cluster security, see [Security concepts for [!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-2019](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)]](concept-security.md).

## Manage and operate with tools

The following articles describe how to manage and operate big data clusters: 

- [Connect to a SQL Server big data cluster with Azure Data Studio](connect-to-big-data-cluster.md)
- [Manage big data clusters for SQL Server controller dashboard](manage-with-controller-dashboard.md)
- [Manage SQL Server Big Data Clusters with Azure Data Studio notebooks](notebooks-manage-bdc.md)
- [Operational notebooks for SQL Server Big Data Clusters](cluster-manage-notebooks.md)
- [Run a sample notebook using Spark](notebooks-tutorial-spark.md)

## Monitor with tools

The following articles describe how to monitor Big Data Clusters: 

- [Monitor Big Data Clusters status by using Azure Data Studio](cluster-monitor-ads.md)
- [Monitor Big Data Clusters by using azdata and kubectl](cluster-monitor-cmdlet.md)
- [Monitor Big Data Clusters by using azdata and Grafana Dashboard](cluster-monitor-grafana.md)
- [Monitor Big Data Clusters by using Juypter Notebooks and Azure Data Studio](cluster-monitor-notebooks.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Internet Explorer browser and older Microsoft Edge browsers aren't compatible with Grafana or Kibana. Consider the [Chromium-based Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedgewelcome.microsoft.com/), or see [supported browsers for Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/requirements/#supported-web-browsers) or [supported browsers for Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_browsers).

## Monitor and inspect logs by using notebooks

The following articles list many of the Jupyter Notebooks that are available in Azure Data Studio:

- [Monitoring clusters by using notebooks](cluster-monitor-notebooks.md)
- [Gathering and analyzing logs in a cluster by using notebooks](cluster-logging-notebooks.md)

## Big Data Clusters troubleshooting resources

The following articles describe how to troubleshoot Big Data Clusters:

- [Troubleshoot Big Data Clusters by using the kubectl utility](cluster-troubleshooting-commands.md) 
- [Troubleshoot a pyspark notebook](troubleshoot-pyspark-notebook.md)
- [Troubleshoot Big Data Clusters by using Juypter Notebooks and Azure Data Studio](cluster-troubleshooter-notebooks.md)
- [Restore HDFS permissions](troubleshoot-hdfs-restore-admin.md)

The following articles describe how to troubleshoot big data clusters deployed in Active Directory mode:
- [Troubleshoot SQL Server Big Data Clusters Active Directory integration](troubleshoot-active-directory.md) 
- [Troubleshoot Active Directory mode login failures](troubleshoot-ad-login-failed-untrusted-domain.md)
- [Troubleshoot Big Data Clusters Active Directory mode deployment stopped](troubleshoot-ad-reverse-lookup-zone.md)


## Where to find [!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-2019](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)] administration notebooks 

[!INCLUDE[big-data-clusters-2019](../includes/ssbigdataclusters-ss-nover.md)] provide a comprehensive administration experience via Jupyter Notebooks. The provided notebooks cover cluster operations, management, monitoring, logging, and troubleshooting.

To add the operational notebook repository from GitHub to Azure Data Studio, you can use keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or select **View**, and then **Command Palette**). Select **Add Remote Book**. 

In the **Add Remote Book** dialogue, select the desired latest version for operational notebooks. Select **Add**, as shown below:

Select **Jupyter Books: Add Remote Book**. A window opens that allows you to select a notebook. You can select the version you want:

When you select **Add**, you'll gain access to all the notebooks for your chosen version on the **Notebooks** tab of Azure Data Studio:
