# Run packages in Integration Services (SSIS) Scale Out
After the packages are deployed to the Integration Services server, you can execute them in Scale Out.

## Run packages with Execute Package In Scale Out dialog 

1. Open the Execute Package In Scale Out dialog box

    In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull_md](../../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], connect to the Integration Services server. In Object Explorer, expand the tree to display the nodes under **Integration Services Catalogs**. Right-click the **SSISDB** node or the project or the package you want to run, and then click **Execute in Scale Out**.

2. Select packages and set the options

    On the **Package Selection** page, you select multiple packages to run and set the environment, parameters, connection managers, and advanced options for each package. Click a package to set these options.
    
    In the **Advanced** tab, you set a Scale Out option called **Retry count**. It sets the number of times a package execution will retry if it fails.

    > [!Note]
    > The **Dump on errors** option only takes effect when the account running Scale Out Worker service is an administrator of local computer.

3. Select machines

    On the **Machine Selection** page, you select the Scale Out Worker machines to run the packages. By default, any machine is allowed to run the packages. 

   > [!Note] 
   > The packages are executed with the credential of the user accounts of the Scale Out Worker services, which are shown on the **Machine Selection** page. 
   >By default, the account is NT Service\SSISScaleOutWorker140. You may want to change to your own lab accounts.

   >[!WARNING]
   >Package executions triggered by different users on the same worker are run with the same account. There is no security boundary among them. 

4. Run the packages and view reports 

    Click **OK** to start the package executions. To view the execution report for a package, right-click the package in Object Explorer, click **Reports**, click **All Executions**, and find the execution.
    
## Run packages with stored procedures

1. Create executions

    Call [catalog].[create_execution] for each package. Set parameter **@runinscaleout** to True. If not all Scale Out Worker machines are allowed to run the package, set parameter **@useanyworker** to False.   

2. Set execution parameters

    Call [catalog].[set_execution_parameter_value] for each execution.

3. Set Scale Out Workers

    Call [catalog].[add_execution_worker]. If any machine is allowed to run the package, you do not need to call this stored procedure. 

4. Start executions

    Call [catalog].[start_execution]. Set parameter **@retry_count** to set the number of times a package execution will retry if it fails.
    
#### Example
The following example runs two packages, package1.dtsx and package2.dtsx, in Scale Out with one Scale Out Worker.  

```sql
Declare @execution_id bigint
EXEC [SSISDB].[catalog].[create_execution] @package_name=N'package1.dtsx', @execution_id=@execution_id OUTPUT, @folder_name=N'folder1', @project_name=N'project1', @use32bitruntime=False, @reference_id=Null, @useanyworker=False, @runinscaleout=True
Select @execution_id
DECLARE @var0 smallint = 1
EXEC [SSISDB].[catalog].[set_execution_parameter_value] @execution_id,  @object_type=50, @parameter_name=N'LOGGING_LEVEL', @parameter_value=@var0
EXEC [SSISDB].[catalog].[add_execution_worker] @execution_id,  @workeragent_id=N'64c020e2-f819-4c2d-a22f-efb31a91e70a'
EXEC [SSISDB].[catalog].[start_execution] @execution_id,  @retry_count=0
GO

Declare @execution_id bigint
EXEC [SSISDB].[catalog].[create_execution] @package_name=N'package2.dtsx', @execution_id=@execution_id OUTPUT, @folder_name=N'folder2', @project_name=N'project2', @use32bitruntime=False, @reference_id=Null, @useanyworker=False, @runinscaleout=True
Select @execution_id
DECLARE @var0 smallint = 1
EXEC [SSISDB].[catalog].[set_execution_parameter_value] @execution_id,  @object_type=50, @parameter_name=N'LOGGING_LEVEL', @parameter_value=@var0
EXEC [SSISDB].[catalog].[add_execution_worker] @execution_id,  @workeragent_id=N'64c020e2-f819-4c2d-a22f-efb31a91e70a'
EXEC [SSISDB].[catalog].[start_execution] @execution_id,  @retry_count=0
GO
```

### Permissions
Running packages in Scale Out requires one the following permissions:

-   Membership in the **ssis_admin** database role  

-   Membership in the **ssis_cluster_executor** database role  
  
-   Membership in the **sysadmin** server role  

## Set default execution mode
To set default execution mode to "Scale Out", right-click the **SSISDB** node in Object Explorer of SSMS and select **Properties**.
In the **Catalog Properities** dialog, set **Server-wide Default execution mode** to **Scale Out**.

After this setting, there's no need to specify the **@runinscaleout** parameter for [catalog].[create_execution]. Executions are executed in Scale Out automatically.

To switch default execution mode back to non-Scale Out mode, just set  **Server-wide Default execution mode** to **Server**.

## Run package in SQL agent job
In Sql agent job, you can choose to run a SSIS package as one step of the job. To run the package in Scale Out, you can leverage the above default execution mode. After setting default execution mode to "Scale Out", packages in Sql agent jobs will be run in Scale Out.
