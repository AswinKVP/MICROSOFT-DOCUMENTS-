## 3. Enable Scale Out
Open SSMS and connect to the local Sql Server instance.
Right-click **Integration Services Catalogs** in the object explorer and select **Create Catalog**.

In the **Create Catalog** dialog, **Enable this server as SSIS scale out master** is selected by default. Just create the catalog as usual.

To enable the Scale Out Worker, switch to **Worker Manager** and select the worker you want to enable. The worker is originally disabled. Click **Enable Worker** to enable it.

## 5. Run packages in Scale Out
Now, you are ready to run SSIS packages in Scale Out. See [Run Packages in Integration Services (SSIS) Scale Out](run-packages-in-integration-services-ssis-scale-out.md).
