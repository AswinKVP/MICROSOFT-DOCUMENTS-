# Connect to on-premises data sources and Azure file shares with Windows Authentication
This article describes how to configure the SSIS Catalog on Azure SQL Database to run packages that use Windows Authentication to connect to on-premises data sources and Azure file shares.

The domain credentials that you provide when you follow the steps in this article apply to all package executions on the SQL Database instance until you change or remove the credentials.

## Connect to on-premises data sources

### Prerequisite
Before you set up domain credentials for Windows Authentication, check whether a non-domain-joined computer can connect to your on-premises data source in `runas` mode.

#### Connecting to SQL Server
To check whether you can connect to an on-premises SQL Server, do the following things:

1.  To run this test, find a non-domain-joined computer.

2.  On the non-domain-joined computer, run the following command to start SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) with the domain credentials that you want to use:

    ```cmd
    runas.exe /netonly /user:<domain>\<username> SSMS.exe
    ```

3.  From SSMS, check whether you can connect to the on-premises SQL Server that you want to use.

#### Connecting to a file share
To check whether you can connect to an on-premises file share, do the following things:

1.  To run this test, find a non-domain-joined computer.

2.  On the non-domain-joined computer, run the following command. This command opens a command prompt window with the domain credentials that you want to use, and then tests connectivity to the file share by getting a directory listing.

    ```cmd
    runas.exe /netonly /user:<domain>\<username> cmd.exe
    dir \\fileshare
    ```

3.  Check whether the directory listing is returned for the on-premises file share that you want to use.

### Provide domain credentials
To provide domain credentials that let packages use Windows Authentication to connect to on-premises data sources, do the following things:

1.  With SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or another tool, connect to the SQL Database that hosts the SSIS Catalog database (SSISDB). For more info, see [Connect to the SSISDB Catalog database on Azure](ssis-azure-connect-to-catalog-database.md).

2.  With SSISDB as the current database, open a query window.

3.  Run the following stored procedure and provide appropriate domain credentials:

    ```sql
    catalog.set_execution_credential @user='<your user name>', @domain='<your domain name>', @password='<your password>'
    ```
4.  Run your SSIS packages. The packages use the credentials that you provided to connect to on-premises data sources with Windows Authentication.

### View domain credentials
To view the active domain credentials, do the following things:

1.  With SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or another tool, connect to the SQL Database that hosts the SSIS Catalog database (SSISDB).

2.  With SSISDB as the current database, open a query window.

3.  Run the following stored procedure and check the output:

    ```sql
    SELECT * 
    FROM catalog.master_properties
    WHERE property_name = 'EXECUTION_DOMAIN' OR property_name = 'EXECUTION_USER'
    ```

### Clear domain credentials
To clear and remove the credentials that you provided as described in this article, do the following things:

1.  With SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or another tool, connect to the SQL Database that hosts the SSIS Catalog database (SSISDB).

2.  With SSISDB as the current database, open a query window.

3.  Run the following stored procedure:

    ```sql
    catalog.set_execution_credential @user='', @domain='', @password=''
    ```

## Connect to file shares
You can use Windows authentication to connect to file shares in the same virtual network as the Azure SSIS Integration Runtime, both on premises and on Azure virtual machines and in Azure Files.

To connect to a file share on an Azure virtual machine or Azure file share, do the following things:

1.  With SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or another tool, connect to the SQL Database that hosts the SSIS Catalog database (SSISDB).

2.  With SSISDB as the current database, open a query window.

3.  Run the `catalog.set_execution_credential` stored procedure as described in the following options:

    a.  To connect to a file share on an Azure virtual machine, run the following stored procedure:

    ```sql
    catalog.set_execution_credential @domain = N'.', @user = N'username of local account on Azure virtual machine', @password = N'password'
    ```

    b.  To connect to an Azure file share (that is, in Azure Files), run the following stored procedure:

    ```sql
    catalog.set_execution_credential @domain = N'Azure', @user = N'<storage-account-name>', @password = N'<storage-account-key>'
    ```

## Next steps
- Deploy a package. For more info, see [Deploy an SSIS project with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](../ssis-quickstart-deploy-ssms.md).
- Run a package. For more info, see [Run an SSIS package with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](../ssis-quickstart-run-ssms.md).
- Schedule a package. For more info, see [Schedule SSIS package execution on Azure](ssis-azure-schedule-packages.md).
