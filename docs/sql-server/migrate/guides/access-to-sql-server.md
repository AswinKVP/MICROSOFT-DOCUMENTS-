# Migration guide: Access to SQL Server
[!INCLUDE[sqlserver](../../../includes/applies-to-version/sqlserver.md)]

This migration guide teaches you to migrate your Microsoft Access databases to SQL Server by using SQL Server Migration for Access (SSMA for Access). 

For other migration guides, see [Database Migration](https://datamigration.microsoft.com/). 

## Prerequisites 

To migrate your Access database to SQL Server, you need:

- To verify your source environment is supported. 
- [SQL Server Migration Assistant for Access](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54255). 
- Connectivity and sufficient permissions to access both source and target. 


## Pre-migration 


After you have met the prerequisites, you are ready to discover the topology of your environment and assess the feasibility of your migration.


### Assess

Use SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Access to review database objects and data, and assess databases for migration. To learn more about the tool, see [SQL Server Migration Assistant for Access](/sql/ssma/access/sql-server-migration-assistant-for-access-accesstosql). 

To create an assessment, follow these steps:

1. Open [SQL Server Migration Assistant for Access](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54255). 
1. Select **File** and then choose **New Project**. 
1. Provide a project name, a location to save your project, and then select a SQL Server migration target from the drop-down. Select **OK**:

   ![New Project](./media/access-to-sql-server/new-project.png)

1. Select **Add Databases** and choose the databases to add to  your project:

   ![Add databases](./media/access-to-sql-server/add-databases.png)

1. In **Access Metadata Explorer**, right-click the database you want to assess, and then choose **Create report**. Alternatively, you can choose **Create report** from the navigation bar after selecting the schema:

   ![Create Report](./media/access-to-sql-server/create-report.png)

1. Review the HTML report to understand conversion statistics and any errors or warnings. You can also open the report in Excel to get an inventory of Access objects and the effort required to perform schema conversions. The default location for the report is in the report folder within SSMAProjects.

   For example: `drive:\<username>\Documents\SSMAProjects\MyAccessMigration\report\report_2020_11_12T02_47_55\`

   ![Sample Report](./media/access-to-sql-server/sample-report.png)

### Validate data types

Validate the default data type mappings and change them based on requirements if necessary. To do so, follow these steps: 

1. Select **Tools** from the menu. 
1. Select **Project Settings**. 
1. Select the **Type mappings** tab:

   ![Type Mappings](./media/access-to-sql-server/type-mappings.png)

1. You can change the type mapping for each table by selecting the table in the **Oracle Metadata explorer**. 


### Convert 

To convert database objects, follow these steps: 

1. Select **Connect to SQL Server** and provide connection details:

   ![Connect to SQL Server](./media/access-to-sql-server/connect-to-sql-server.png)

1. Right-click the database in **Access Metadata Explorer** and choose **Convert schema**. Alternatively, you can choose **Convert schema** from the top line navigation bar after choosing your database:

   ![Convert the schema](./media/access-to-sql-server/convert-schema.png)

1. After the conversion completes, compare and review the converted objects to the original objects to identify potential problems and address them based on the recommendations:

   ![Compare converted queries ](./media/access-to-sql-server/query-comparison.png)

   Compare the converted Transact-SQL text to the original code and review the recommendations:

   ![Review converted objects](./media/access-to-sql-server/table-comparison.png)

1. (Optional) To convert an individual object, right-click the object and choose **Convert schema**. An object that has been converted appears bold in the **Access Metadata Explorer**: 

   ![Bold objects in metadata explorer have been converted](./media/access-to-sql-server/converted-items-bold.png)
 
1. Select **Review results** in the Output pane, and review errors in the **Error list** pane. 
1. Save the project locally for an offline schema remediation exercise. Select **Save Project** from the **File** menu. This gives you an opportunity to evaluate the source and target schemas offline and perform remediation before you can publish the schema to SQL Server.


## Migrate

After you have completed assessing your databases and addressing any discrepancies, the next step is to execute the migration process. Migrating data is a bulk-load operation that moves rows of data into SQL Server in transactions. The number of rows to be loaded into SQL Server in each transaction is configured in the project settings.

To publish your schema and migrate the data using SSMA for Access, follow these steps: 

1. If you haven't already, select **Connect to SQL Server** and provide connection details. 

1. Publish the schema: Right-click the database from the **SQL Server Metadata Explorer** and choose **Synchronize with Database**. This action publishes the MySQL schema to SQL Server:

   ![Synchronize with Database](./media/access-to-sql-server/synchronize-with-database.png)

   Review the mapping between your source project and your target:

   ![Review the synchronization with the database](./media/access-to-sql-server/synchronize-with-database-review.png)

1. Migrate the data: Right-click the database or object you want to migrate in **Access Metadata Explorer**, and choose **Migrate data**. Alternatively, you can select **Migrate Data** from the top-line navigation bar. To migrate data for an entire database, select the check box next to the database name. To migrate data from individual tables, expand the database, expand Tables, and then select the check box next to the table. To omit data from individual tables, clear the check box:

   ![Migrate Data](./media/access-to-sql-server/migrate-data.png)

1. After migration completes, view the **Data Migration Report**:  

   ![Migrate Data Review](./media/access-to-sql-server/migrate-data-review.png)

1. Connect to your SQL Server instance by using [SQL Server Management Studio](/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) and validate the migration by reviewing the data and schema: 

   ![Validate in SSMA](./media/access-to-sql-server/validate-in-ssms.png)



## Post-migration 

After you have successfully completed the **Migration** stage, you need to go through a series of post-migration tasks to ensure that everything is functioning as smoothly and efficiently as possible.

### Remediate applications

After the data is migrated to the target environment, all the applications that formerly consumed the source need to start consuming the target. Accomplishing this will in some cases require changes to the applications.

### Perform tests

The test approach for database migration consists of performing the following activities:

1. **Develop validation tests**. To test database migration, you need to use SQL queries. You must create the validation queries to run against both the source and the target databases. Your validation queries should cover the scope you have defined.

2. **Set up test environment**. The test environment should contain a copy of the source database and the target database. Be sure to isolate the test environment.

3. **Run validation tests**. Run the validation tests against the source and the target, and then analyze the results.

4. **Run performance tests**. Run performance test against the source and the target, and then analyze and compare the results.


### Optimize

The post-migration phase is crucial for reconciling any data accuracy issues and verifying completeness, as well as addressing performance issues with the workload.

> [!Note]
> For additional detail about these issues and specific steps to mitigate them, see the [Post-migration Validation and Optimization Guide](../../../relational-databases/post-migration-validation-and-optimization-guide.md).
