# New and Recently Updated: Relational Databases docs



Nearly every day Microsoft updates some of its existing articles on its [Docs.Microsoft.com](http://docs.microsoft.com/) documentation website. This article displays excerpts from recently updated articles. Links to new articles might also be listed.

This article is generated by a program that is rerun periodically. Occasionally an excerpt can appear with imperfect formatting, or as markdown from the source article. Images are never displayed here.

Recent updates are reported for the following date range and subject:



- *Date range of updates:* &nbsp; **2017-09-11** &nbsp; -to- &nbsp; **2017-09-27**
- *Subject area:* &nbsp; **Relational Databases**.

## Updated Articles with Excerpts

This section displays the excerpts of updates gathered from articles that have recently experienced a large update.

The excerpts displayed here appear separated from their proper semantic context. Also, sometimes an excerpt is separated from important markdown syntax that surrounds it in the actual article. Therefore these excerpts are for general guidance only. The excerpts only enable you to know whether your interests warrant taking the time to click and visit the actual article.

For these and other reasons, do not copy code from these excerpts, and do not take as exact truth any text excerpt. Instead, visit the actual article.

 -  There are two types of spatial data. The **geometry** data type supports planar, or Euclidean (flat-earth), data. The **geometry** data type both conforms to the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Simple Features for SQL Specification version 1.1.0 and is compliant with SQL MM (ISO standard).
 -
 - In addition, ..!NCLUDE-NotShown--ssNoVersion--../../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] supports the **geography** data type, which stores ellipsoidal (round-earth) data, such as GPS latitude and longitude coordinates.
 -

 ->  For a detailed description and examples of spatial features introduced in ..!NCLUDE-NotShown--ssSQL11--../../includes/sssql11-md.md)], including enhancements to the spatial data types, download the white paper, [New Spatial Features in SQL Server Code-Named "Denali"](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=226407).

 -##  <a name="objects"></a> Spatial Data Objects
 - The **geometry** and **geography** data types support sixteen spatial data objects, or instance types. However, only eleven of these instance types are *instantiable*; you can create and work with these instances (or instantiate them) in a database. These instances derive certain properties from their parent data types that distinguish them as **Points**, **LineStrings, CircularStrings**, **CompoundCurves**, **Polygons**, **CurvePolygons** or as multiple **geometry** or **geography** instances in a **GeometryCollection**. **Geography** type has an additional instance type, **FullGlobe**.
 -
 - The figure below depicts the **geometry** hierarchy upon which the **geometry** and **geography** data types are based. The instantiable types of **geometry** and **geography** are indicated in blue.
 -
 - ![geom_hierarchy--../../relational-databases/spatial/media/geom-hierarchy.gif)
 -
 - As the figure indicates, the ten instantiable types of the **geometry** and **geography** data types are **Point**, **MultiPoint**, **LineString**, **CircularString**, **MultiLineString**, **CompoundCurve**, **Polygon**, **CurvePolygon**, **MultiPolygon**, and **GeometryCollection**. There is one additional instantiable type for the geography data type: **FullGlobe**. The **geometry** and **geography** types can recognize a specific instance as long as it is a well-formed instance, even if the instance is not defined explicitly. For example, if you define a **Point** instance explicitly using the STPointFromText() method, **geometry** and **geography** recognize the instance as a **Point**, as long as the method input is well-formed. If you define the same instance using the `STGeomFromText()` method, both the **geometry** and **geography** data types recognize the instance as a **Point**.
