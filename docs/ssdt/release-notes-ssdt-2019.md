- Sometimes this product or Visual Studio Tools for Applications 2019 may be somehow deleted during VS instance upgrade. If your existing SSIS projects cannot be loaded, try to repair this product via control panel. If VS doesn't pop up when clicking on "Edit Script", try to repair VSTA 2019 via control panel. We've reported this issue to VS team. Sorry for any inconvenience.
