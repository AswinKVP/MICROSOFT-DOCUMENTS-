# Troubleshooting Database Migration Assessment for Oracle extension errors

This article explains how to determine, diagnose, and fix issues/errors that you might encounter when you use  Database Migration Assessment for Oracle extension.



## Troubleshoot

To troubleshoot any Database Migration Assessment for Oracle extension issue, you may have to find out the details  about the error, and warnings from the logs generated. Refer this section to access the logs.



### Logs

The extension stores errors, warnings, and other diagnostic logs in the default log directory:

- Windows - `C:\Users\<username>.dmaoracle\logs\`
- Linux - `~/.dmaoracle/logs`
- macOS - `/Users/<username>/.dmaoracle/logs`

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the extension stores the last seven log files.
To change the log directory, update the `LogDirectory` property in the extension settings file.

|Operating system|Path|
|---|---|
|Windows|`C:\Users\<username>\.azuredatastudio\extensions\microsoft.azuredatastudio-dma-oracle-<VersionNumber>\bin\service\Properties\ConfigSettings\extension-settings.json`|
|Linux|`~/.azuredatastudio/extensions/microsoft.azuredatastudio-dma-oracle-/<VersionNumber>/bin/service/Properties/ConfigSettings/extension-settings.json`|
|macOS|`/Users/<username>/.azuredatastudio/extensions/microsoft.azuredatastudio-dma-oracle-/<VersionNumber>/bin/service/Properties/ConfigSettings/extension-settings.json`|
