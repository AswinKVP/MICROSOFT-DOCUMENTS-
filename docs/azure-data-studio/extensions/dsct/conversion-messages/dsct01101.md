# DSCT01101: Sequence will not guarantee the order of values (Info)

This article covers the reason why Database Schema Conversion Toolkit may produce converted sequences that will not guarantee the order of values.

## Background

Oracle database supports an additional `ORDER` option when creating a sequence, which guarantees that sequence numbers are issued in the order of requests. This is useful when sequence numbers are used as timestamps. Microsoft SQL platform does not have a similar option, and sequence numbers are not guaranteed to be generated in order of requests.

## Example

Consider the below sequence with the `ORDER` option specified.

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE ORDERED_SEQ
    MINVALUE 0
    MAXVALUE 1000
    ORDER
```

The `ORDER` option will not be converted when targeting the Microsoft SQL platform, and `DSCT01101` informational message will be produced.

## Possible remedies

In general, it is very rare when the order in which sequence numbers are issued matters, but Database Schema Conversion Toolkit produces an informational message, so that you can review and ensure that the order of generated numbers is not significant in the specific use case.

If you identify that order matters, then consider creating a helper table that can be used to generate sequential numbers in the desired order.
